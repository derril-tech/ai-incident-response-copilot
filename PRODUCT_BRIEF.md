AI Incident Response Copilot — CrewAI orchestrates post-incident reports & forensics 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“Automate incident retrospectives with AI agents that collect evidence, correlate timelines, and draft full post-incident reports—complete with remediation steps and audit trails.” 

What it produces 

Incident timelines: correlated log excerpts, alert timestamps, operator actions, comms, and mitigation events. 

Forensic bundles: evidence artifacts (pcaps, process trees, IOC sightings, memory extracts) with hashes + chain-of-custody metadata. 

Root cause narratives: causal chains, contributing factors, ATT&CK technique mapping, detection gaps. 

Post-incident report drafts: executive summary, timeline, impact analysis, root cause, remediation & follow-up tasks. 

Exports: PDF postmortem, JSON/Markdown reports, STIX/TAXII IOC feeds, Jira/ServiceNow tasks, evidence tarballs. 

Scope/Safety 

Human-in-the-loop always: reports + response plans flagged as draft until reviewed by IR lead. 

Immutable evidence handling: cryptographic hash on all artifacts, WORM storage. 

Explicit disclaimers: support tool, not a substitute for certified DFIR/legal experts. 

 

2) Target User 

Incident Response teams (IR, CERT/SOC) under pressure to close incidents quickly. 

CISOs & Security leadership needing executive-ready postmortems. 

Forensic analysts assembling artifacts into chain-of-custody packages. 

Compliance/GRC tracking remediation, audit, and SLA adherence. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Evidence Collection 

Connectors: SIEM (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel, Chronicle), EDR/XDR, NDR, Cloud audit logs, SaaS (Okta, O365, Slack, GitHub). 

Artifacts: pcaps, memory dumps, forensic disk images, Sysmon traces, email headers. 

Integrity: SHA-256 hash, timestamp, signer identity. 

Legal hold toggles; tamper-proof store. 

Timeline Correlation 

Merge alerts, logs, commands, comms into single sequence. 

Normalize timestamps with TZ + NTP correction. 

Entity linking: user, host, IP, process, file, SaaS app. 

Annotations: analyst notes, decision rationales, escalation markers. 

Forensic Analysis 

IOC sightings across logs; pivot graph. 

Process tree reconstruction from EDR. 

Memory/disk triage: suspicious DLLs, persistence, tools-of-trade (Mimikatz, CobaltStrike). 

Beaconing & anomaly detection (inter-packet jitter, entropy). 

Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques. 

Report Generation 

CrewAI multi-agent orchestration: 

Collector agent: gather inputs from connectors. 

Correlator agent: build ordered timeline. 

Forensic analyst agent: IOC + ATT&CK mapping. 

Writer agent: produce post-incident report draft. 

Reviewer agent: cross-check with templates + ensure compliance. 

Templates: Executive Summary, Detailed Timeline, Root Cause Analysis, Remediation, Lessons Learned. 

Response & Remediation 

Draft SOAR tasks (disable IAM, reset creds, patch systems). 

Suggest playbooks (containment, eradication, recovery). 

Track follow-up tasks (training, monitoring coverage, detection gaps). 

Governance & Compliance 

Immutable audit log. 

SLA dashboards (MTTD, MTTR, dwell time). 

Compliance evidence packs (ISO 27001 A.16, SOC 2 CC7, PCI DSS 12.10). 

Redacted/shareable versions for regulators/clients. 

 

4) Backend Architecture (Extremely Detailed & Deployment-Ready) 

4.1 Topology 

Frontend/BFF: Next.js 14 (Vercel). Server Actions for evidence uploads/exports; SSR for timelines & reports. 

API Gateway: NestJS (Node 20) — REST /v1, OpenAPI 3.1, Casbin RBAC, RLS by org_id, Idempotency-Key, Problem+JSON, Request-ID (ULID). 

CrewAI Orchestrator (Python 3.11 + FastAPI control): manages multi-agent workflows. 

Workers 

collector-worker: connector pulls, evidence upload/normalize. 

timeline-worker: correlation, entity linking, ordering. 

forensic-worker: IOC enrichment, ATT&CK mapping, anomaly scans. 

report-worker: CrewAI orchestrator → narrative/report generation. 

export-worker: PDF, JSON, STIX, Markdown, tarball builds. 

Event bus: NATS subjects (incident.collect, timeline.build, forensic.run, report.draft, export.make) + Redis Streams for SSE/progress. 

Data 

Postgres 16 + pgvector (incidents, artifacts, timelines, reports, embeddings). 

ClickHouse (high-volume events/logs). 

S3/R2 (artifacts, exports). 

Redis (session state, cache, queues). 

Observability: OpenTelemetry traces; Prometheus/Grafana; Sentry. 

Secrets: Cloud KMS; per-tenant encryption envelopes.

Timeline: auto-built; scrub events; annotate with notes. 

Forensic Analysis: ATT&CK heatmap + IOC sightings visualized. 

Report Drafting: AI suggests narrative → reviewer approves/edits → finalize. 

Response Board: playbooks → assign tasks → close actions. 

Export: choose PDF/JSON/MD/STIX bundle; archive to S3. 

5.4 Validation & Errors 

Problem+JSON toasts; cannot export until all artifacts hashed & timeline validated. 

Draft watermark until IR lead approves. 

SLA breach warnings on dashboards. 

5.5 Accessibility & i18n 

Screen-reader labels; keyboard-first; color-blind safe palettes. 

Multi-locale reports (en, de, fr, jp). 

 

6) SDKs & Integration Contracts

7) DevOps & Deployment 

FE: Vercel (Next.js). 

APIs/Workers: GKE/Fly/Render; CrewAI orchestrator on dedicated GPU nodes. 

DB: Managed Postgres + pgvector; PITR; read replicas. 

Events: Redis + NATS; DLQ w/ backoff. 

Storage: S3/R2 with WORM buckets for artifacts. 

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint, tests, model checksum, image scan, deploy). 

SLOs 

Artifact ingest & hash < 15s p95. 

Timeline correlation for 10k events < 45s p95. 

Draft report generation < 90s p95. 

Export PDF/JSON < 10s p95. 

 

8) Testing 

Unit: artifact hashing, timeline sort, ATT&CK mapper, export validator. 

Integration: ingest → correlate → forensic → draft → export. 

Golden sets: past labeled incidents to validate RCA accuracy. 

Load/Chaos: 100 concurrent incidents; 10M event timeline; simulate missing logs. 

Security: RLS coverage; WORM immutability; audit log tamper tests. 

 

9) Success Criteria
